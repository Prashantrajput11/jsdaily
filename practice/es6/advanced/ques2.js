// 2.	Problem: Creating a Custom Product Display (Rest Operator, Array Destructuring)
// •	Scenario: On your ecommerce site, you’re building a feature that highlights the top 3 most expensive products, but you also need to display the remaining items as “other products.”

const productList = [
	{ id: 1, name: "Smartphone", price: 900 },
	{ id: 2, name: "Laptop", price: 1500 },
	{ id: 3, name: "Tablet", price: 600 },
	{ id: 4, name: "Smartwatch", price: 300 },
	{ id: 5, name: "Headphones", price: 200 },
];

// Task: Use array destructuring to extract the top 3 products, and put the rest into a separate “other products” array.
